# Technical Design Document

## 1. HTML Structure

The `index.html` file will contain:

*   Three sections, one for each package size, each with:
    *   The dimensions of the package displayed as text.
    *   An input field for the quantity.
*   A button to trigger the calculation.
*   A designated area to display:
    *   The calculated total cubic feet for each package size.
    *   The combined total cubic feet.
    *   The total cubic feet of a 40-foot high cube container.

## 2. CSS Styling

*   The CSS will be used to style the sections and layout for a clear and user-friendly presentation.

## 3. JavaScript Logic

The `script.js` file will contain:

*   An event listener for the calculate button.
*   A function to retrieve the quantity values from the three input fields.
*   A function to calculate the cubic feet for each package size. The dimensions will be converted from inches to feet. The formula for each package will be: `(length / 12) * (width / 12) * (height / 12) * quantity`.
*   A function to calculate the combined total cubic feet.
*   A function to update the HTML to display the results.
