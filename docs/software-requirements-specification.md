# Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a web-based cubic feet calculator. The calculator will allow users to input dimensions (length, width, height) and quantity to calculate the total cubic feet.

## 2. Functional Requirements

*   The user shall be able to input quantities for five different package sizes:
    *   6 rolls (pack of 10): 23 x 20 x 14 in
    *   12 rolls: 17.909 x 13.740 x 4.880 in
    *   24 rolls: 17.900 x 13.400 x 9.299 in
    *   48 rolls: 17.500 x 17.500 x 13.500 in
    *   12 box: 17 x 13.85 x 7.75 in
*   The system shall calculate the total cubic feet for each package size based on the user's input.
*   The system shall display the total cubic feet for each package size.
*   The system shall display the total combined cubic feet for all packages.
*   The system shall display the total cubic feet of a 40-foot high cube container (2,694 cubic feet).

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

*   The application will be a single-page web application.
*   The application will be purely front-end; no back-end is required.
*   The user interface should be simple and intuitive.
